Neighbourhood empowerment is salient to citizens and that\u2019s why, the idea of empowering people to shape or make decisions in their neighbourhoods is gathering momentum around the world. If the research is done well, then there are multiple benefits for corporates as well as local citizens:\n\n\u2022\tImprove the quality of decision-making and levels of citizen engagement\n\n\u2022\tHelping to rebuild legitimacy and make bureaucracies more responsive\n\n\u2022\tDevelop new sources of social value. \n\nIf the research is done badly, then it can lead to conflict, growing inequalities and failing public services.\n\nYou know what they say about buying or renting a home: location, location, location. Neighbourhood matters a lot when it comes to how satisfied people are in their house or apartment and it can be a real deal breaker (or deal-maker) when people are searching for the neighbourhoods. And while it\u2019s hard to really know a place until you live there, taking the time to research a neighbourhood before you move can help ensure that you don\u2019t accidentally end up with a big case of buyer\u2019s or renter\u2019s remorse later on. Digging into the details of a neighbourhood before committing to living there can save you a lot of headaches later on."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Problem to Solve:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The major purpose of this project is define the parameters for helping people move in to better and most preferred neighbourhoods of the New York borough of Canada.
